# FIrebase-Authentication

1-Create Firebase Account.
2- Make your first app in firebase dashboard.
3- paste your link into Constants.java at FIREBASE_URL.
4-Run the app in your Mobile.

In this app you have a bad background,It is because of there is no drawable in this project but you can add your drawable , Initially i put 
mipmap/ic_launcher but you can give whatever image you want to be in background.

If someone is finding problem in login with google , go to sign up and then sign up, I will fix that bug very soon.

This app is created by the help of udacity resources .
